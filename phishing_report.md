Phishing Email Analysis Report
Email Subject:
Security Alert: Unusual Login Attempt on Your Nykaa Account

1. Sender Email Spoofing
From address: nykaashop@gmail.com
Issue: Nykaa is a professional company, and it should not use a free Gmail address for alerts. A legitimate email would likely be something like security@nykaa.com.
Indicator: Spoofed or impersonated sender domain.

2. Suspicious Content & Tone
The message uses urgent language:
"Unusual Login Attempt Detected"
"Verify your account immediately to avoid temporary suspension"
Indicator: Phishing emails often create urgency to trick users into acting quickly.

3. Suspicious IP and Location
Mentions login attempt from Nigeria with IP 102.89.45.22
This could be fake or used to alarm the user.
Indicator: Geolocation scare tactics are commonly used in phishing.

4. Phishing Link
The "Verify Account" button leads to:
http://192.168.60.3:8080/login.php?rid=gEGN836
Issues:
IP address URL instead of a domain (not professional).
192.168.x.x is a local IP address — this wouldn’t be used by Nykaa.
Website is not secure (http and “Not secure” warning).
Indicator: Mismatched, insecure, and suspicious URLs.

5. Login Page Clone
The login page mimics Nykaa’s look but is hosted on a local or private server.
No HTTPS, no valid domain, no SSL certificate.
Likely attempts to harvest credentials.
Indicator: Fake login portal, typical of phishing.

6. Grammar and Professionalism
Content is grammatically decent, but the structure and formatting still feel unprofessional.
No personalization (just "Dear User").
Real companies typically address you by name.
Indicator: Lack of personalization and poor format.
